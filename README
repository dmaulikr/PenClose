Many school hours are spent on scribbling around, so now's the time to save your paper and ink. PenClose is a smooth dots variant drawn on realistic graph paper, free and with no ads at all!

Two players alternately put a horizontal or vertical mark inside a zoomable diamond frame. A square is conquered if a player puts the last enclosing mark. The player who fills a square is allowed to put another mark. The game ends when the diamond is full and owned squares count determines the winning player.

PenClose is currently multiplayer only but no, you won't be forced to share your little screen to play with a friend. PenClose also supports nearby communication thanks to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. iPad users are welcome since the app is Universal.
